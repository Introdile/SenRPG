# SenRPG
Just a little turn-based RPG made in the Godot engine.
I'm not the most experience programmer, but I'm learning a lot by attempting this.

The first step of my roadmap is to get the combat system working.

Steps yet required for that:
- Implement targetting
- Implement status effects
- Implement turn order display
- Implement action indicator

    Display chosen action for ally and enemy characters. Enemy actions will be shown as "Attack" or "Buff" instead of anything specific
- Implement 'parry' 

    When a character's speed, mid-combat would change to have their action occur after a foe's turn, it would cancel the foe's action (if both actions were attacks)
- Implement item usage
- Implement aggro & enemy AI

    Aggro will simply be the chance of a foe targetting a specific ally during a round
- Update UI
- Add additional animations (character stepping forward when targetting, character posing when action is selected, etc)

There may be others I can't think of off the top of my head.
